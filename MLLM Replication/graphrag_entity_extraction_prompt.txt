-Goal-

Each document is about the description of a video and the authenticity rating of this video. 
Identify all entities, their entity types from the video description and all relationships among the identified entities. You should also identify these entities' relationships with the corresponding authenticity score.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Provide a name for the entity, starting with a descriptive term, in CAPITALIZED form.
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. 
- entity_description: Provide comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities

Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. Identify the video with authenticity rating in addition to the entities identified in Step 1:
- entity_name: Name of the video with its authenticity rating, which is recorded at the beginning of the document. The name should be one of {"LOW AUTHENTIC VIDEO", "MODERATE LOW AUTHENTIC VIDEO", "NEUTRAL AUTHENTIC VIDEO", "MODERATE HIGH AUTHENTIC VIDEO", "HIGH AUTHENTIC VIDEO"}
- entity_type: It should be "VIDEO WITH AUTHENTICITY".
- entity_description: description of this video's authenticity level.
Format this entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)


3. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are clearly *related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1 
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score (1 to 10) indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

4. Record all the entities (identified in step 1) contained in the corresponding authenticity level video.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: The video with its authenticity rating, as identified in Step 2.
- target_entity: Name of the target entity, as identified in Step 1
- relationship_description: Explanation of why this {LOW, MODERATE LOW, NEUTRAL, MODERATE HIGH, HIGH} AUTHENTIC VIDEO contains the target entity.
- relationship_strength: A numeric score (1 to 10) indicating the strength of the relationship.
 Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)
 

5. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1, 2, 3, 4. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.
 
6. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}
